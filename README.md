# PRODIGY_ML_02

## Project Overview

This project uses K-means clustering to group customers into clusters. The analysis helps in understanding different customer segments, which can be valuable for tailoring marketing strategies and improving customer engagement.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Mall_Customers.csv` and includes the following columns:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: Spending score assigned to the customer.

### Steps
1. **Load and Inspect Data**: Load the dataset and inspect the data structure.
2. **Preprocess Data**: Select relevant features for clustering and standardize them.
3. **Determine Optimal Clusters**: Use the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters.
4. **Apply K-means Clustering**: Perform clustering and assign cluster labels.
5. **Visualize Results**: Create visualizations to understand the clustering results.
